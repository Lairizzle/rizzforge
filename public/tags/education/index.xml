      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;pain-with-a-side-of-pain&#34;&gt;Pain With a Side of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the last several months I have avoided the trap of Linux distro hopping. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Arch happily, but I did switch between KDE Plasma and Gnome. I wanted&#xA;to at least test out a few DE&amp;rsquo;s and see which had the most appeal. One night while watching youtube I came across a video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen&#34;&gt;ThePrimeagen&lt;/a&gt; absolutely blasting through his code using &lt;a href=&#34;https://neovim.io/&#34;&gt;NeoVim&lt;/a&gt;. I was flabbergasted at how quickly and efficiently he was able to navigate his editor. I&amp;rsquo;d previously had the misfortune of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; once or twice and having no idea how to edit anything or even close it and I usually found myself defaulting to nano if I had no option outside&#xA;of the CLI. I decided this time I would be more deliberate in my approach and put in a true effort to use and learn Vim. Spoiler alert: It. Is. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Keith. I am a Dad and a tech enthusiast who was raised by the internet. I am a Linux and FOSS (free and open source software) proponent who works professionally with things like SQL server, Datameer, Tableau, Python and much more. I like to think that I am fairly creative, whether that be with art and music or programming and game development. Learning has always been a top priority for me and expanding my knowledge and skill sets is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
