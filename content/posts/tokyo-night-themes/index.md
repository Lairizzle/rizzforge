## Exploring Tokyo Night
After using Gruvbox for some time I felt I wanted a bit of a change in terms of themes. After exploring the plethora of colour scheme options I settled on Tokyo Night, based on the [Tokyo Night Neovim theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim). So far I've been really enjoying it, but I wanted to keep my old Gruvbox dots in order and create a new repo for my Tokyo Night dots. The only issue I ran into was finding Tokyo Night themes for certain applications (like Midnight Commander and Rofi). I had no choice but to create me own!

## Creating Themes
I started with porting Tokyo Night to a Midnight Commander skin. It was not too bad and only took a little bit of trial and error. It ended up turning out pretty good. I used this [Gruvbox Midnight Commander Theme](https://github.com/twalderman/mc-gruvbox-skin) as a starting point to see how the MC skins work. You can check it out below.



Next I needed to create a theme for Rofi. I had done this before, so I was somewhat familiar with the process. Either way, I was able to create it made a dedicated repo for it as well, since the one I found was not exactly what I was going for. You can check it out at the repo below.



## Waybar & Hyprland
Lastly was just some updates to my waybar, hyprland and a few other dot files. I didn't create dedicated repos for these individually, but I did create a new dot repo for this colour scheme. You can find it below.



## Learning
Tokyo Night is a fantastic colour scheme that is really easy on the eyes. It has been a refreshing change. I learned quite a bit while creating the midnight commander theme and look forward to adding other theme options for applications in the future.
