      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspiration&#34;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with someone who hangs out in a mutual discord and I was reading through their personal blog. I noticed they had included something called a blog roll, where they add blogs they follow or find interesting. On this list there was a link to a very minimalist blog. It was actually this one, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mijndertstuij.nl/&#34;&gt;Mijndert Stuij&lt;/a&gt;. I have to admit it made me immediately jealous. It was so simple, yet so effective. I knew that I would be revamping my entire blog shortly after seeing this. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
