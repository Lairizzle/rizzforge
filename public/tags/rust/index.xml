      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-sucks&#34;&gt;Moving Sucks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We recently sold our home and were tasked with finding a new one. Without going into detail the entire experience was less than desirable. The dust has finally settled and life has returned to some normalcy. We have not moved houses yet, but the houses are bought and sold, and I would say that is the worst part of the entire thing. Now that it is over I have been able to relax a bit and focus on some of the things I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
